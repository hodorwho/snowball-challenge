<div id = "about">
<p>
	It has been uncovered that a large portion of the workers in the textile industry endure hazardous working conditions, long working hours and extremely low wages. <br><br>
	As consumers, we recognize our responsibilities towards the humans behind our clothes and have a desire to do better. Often, however, we lack the options to put these wishes into action.<br><br>
	The FairSeam app is a way to show our gratitude towards these workers, by enabling consumers to give money directly to the person behind their clothes. A couple of dollars
	isn't a lot to you, but it can be life changing for her. <br><br>
	Althouth the clothing indistry remains passive, that doesn't mean we have to.
